    # Much simplified version of lockin, and hopefully faster?
    # With respect to lockIn, change the following:
    #   -arbitrary number of signals, passed as an array:
    #       i.e. signals[:, 0] is first signal, signals[:, 1] is second...
    #   -no distinction between a 'carrier' and a 'signal'
    #   -doesn't fit to a carrier signal, just generates a sine at nominalFreq
    #   -hence, nominalFreq is promoted to a required argument
    #   -can lock in at multiple harmonics in one function call
    #   -doesn't perform the convolution step, as that is possibly slow,
    #       and the decimation step is sufficient to filter the timestreams

    #       of the signal
